When she talked to him, she could also see that he had other bruising as well. His arm presented a significant bruise. It is unknown whether Samuel has other bruises. When asked whether he was hurt anywhere else, he said no but would not make eye-contact when he said it. He never had a problem talking to and looking at the school nurse before. Considering the visible bruising and the lack of eye- contact, there is concern that physical abuse is present in the home.",
